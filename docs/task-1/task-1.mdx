# On-premises installation

This page provides an overview of the Datalore on-premises installation methods. While you can go straight to the detailed installation topics, we recommend reviewing this overview to gain a complete understanding of the entire process.

## Installation process overview

:::note
Normally, a new Datalore deployment takes about an hour, as long as there aren't any unexpected infrastructure problems.
:::

The installation process includes the following steps:

- [Setting up infrastructure & choosing an installation method](#setting-up-infrastructure--choosing-an-installation-method)

- [Install datalore](#install-datalore)

- [Required and optional configuration procedures](#required-and-optional-configuration-procedures)

- [Upgrading Datalore](#upgrading-datalore)

## On-premises installation & configuration

### Set up infrastructure & choose an installation method <MajorUpdate/>

:::caution
Currently, Datalore supports only 64-bit Linux as a host system. **ARM-based platforms, macOS, and Windows are not supported yet.**
:::

Before installing Datalore on-premises, set up the platform where you'll deploy it. Once your platform is ready, choose the [installation method](#install-datalore) that suits your needs.

Check the table below to review your infrastructure options and compare installation methods.

<DeploymentTable/>

### Install Datalore

Once you chose infrastructure, follow the installation procedure to launch Datalore on-premises. Check one of the guides below based on your selected method:

- [Docker-based installation](/datalore/task-1/docker)
- [Kubernetes-based installation](/datalore/task-1/kubernetes)

Once installation process is complete, Datalore on-premises will be ready for use, and your first signed-up user will have super admin rights.

### Upgrade Datalore

Each installation method has its own upgrade procedure. Check the guides below to upgrade Datalore on-premises:

- Upgrade Datalore with [Docker](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/datalore/upgrade-datalore-on-premises-docker-installation.html)
- Upgrade Datalore with [Kubernetes](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/datalore/upgrade-datalore-on-premises-helm-installation.html)

:::note
We’ll notify you as soon as we release ne version of Datalore, so you can upgrade your on-premise deployment without delay.

As a rule, Docker deployments update faster and more easily than Kubernetes ones.
