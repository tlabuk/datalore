# Docker-based installation

This document details the process of installing, configuring, and updating Datalore on-premises using the Docker Compose method.

If your primary objective is to quickly familiarize yourself with the product and its core features, we recommend opting for the Docker-based installation. This approach offers a simpler and faster setup compared to the Helm-based method.

:::tip recommended deployment platform
If you haven’t yet selected a platform or service, we recommend trying Datalore On-Premises on an AWS EC2 instance.

For step-by-step instructions on setting up your AWS infrastructure, check [this guide](https://community.aws/content/2duq9xSYespeSBQ5R1WiuOcCvMj/using-ec2-userdata-to-bootstrap-python-web-app).

## What to expect <MajorUpdates/>

In this document you'll find detailed instructions and references about the following steps:
- [Basic installation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/datalore/install-datalore-on-premises-using-docker.html#basic-datalore-installation_docker): Complete the basic procedure to get Datalore On-Premises up and running on the infrastructure of your choice.
- [Required and optional configuration procedures](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/datalore/configuration-procedures-docker.html): Customize and configure Datalore on-premises. Some of these configurations are essential for you to start working on your projects.
- [Upgrade procedure](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/datalore/upgrade-datalore-on-premises-docker-installation.html): Upgrade your version of Datalore On-Premises. We duly notify you of our new releases.

## Prerequisites <MajorUpdates/>

### Docker and Docker Compose

To proceed with Docker deployment, make sure you have the following in place:

- Docker
- Docker Compose V2

You can check the requirements by running the docker `compose version command` in your terminal. If you see the following output, you're good to go:

```text
$ docker compose version

Docker Compose version v2.31.0-desktop.2
```

If you need to install Docker, check [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) for instructions. On **Windows** and **Mac**, Docker Compose is bundled with Docker Desktop. If you're using **Linux**, you'll need to install Docker Compose separately.

:::tip
If you use a reverse proxy, we recommend activating gzip compression by following [these instructions](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_module.html).
:::

### Hardware requirements <MajorUpdates/>

We recommend the following hardware set-up for running Datalore on-premises:
- **Datalore server machine**: `≥4GB RAM`. If you're not expecting a heavy workload, the number of CPUs isn’t as crucial a factor
- **For every concurrently run notebook**: `≥4GB RAM`

## Installation steps <MajorUpdates/>

:::danger important
When customizing the deployment, make sure you don’t change the user for the datalore-server container.

The container runs using the default user defined in the Docker image. Changing or adding a user property might lead to unexpected issues with the deployment.
:::

### Install Datalore <MajorUpdates/>

1. Download the `docker-compose.yaml` from the [Datalore configs](https://github.com/JetBrains/datalore-configs/tree/2025.1/docker-compose) repository.

2. Change `datalore.environment.DB_PASSWORD` and `postgresql.environment.POSTGRES_PASSWORD` with any random string (both properties must have the same values). They'll be used as your database password. Make sure you keep those strings secret.

3. Go to your terminal and:
    -  Move to the directory where you saved the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

        ```bash
        cd /path/to/docker-compose.yaml
        ```
    - Run the following command to start Datalore:

        ```bash
        docker compose up -d
        ```
4. In your browser, go to `http://localhost:8080` to access Datalore. Sign up as the first user to get **Super Admin** permissions.

    <Zoom src='/datalore/img/deploy/docker/docker-1.png' alt='Datalore sign-up page' />

    :::tip
    If you haven't set up email service, you won’t receive a confirmation email. You can log in immediately after signing up.
    :::

5. To access Datalore by a domain other than `localhost`, add a URL with this host as the `DATALORE_PUBLIC_URL` parameter in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.<br/><br/>For example, if you want to use the https://datalore.yourcompany.com domain, add the following value to the `datalore.environment` section:

    ```yaml title='Add custom URL to Docker config'
    services:
        datalore:
            ...
            environment:
                ...
                DATALORE_PUBLIC_URL: "https://datalore.yourcompany.com"
    ```
    :::caution
    Make sure the URL doesn't contain trailing slash. You'll need to configure your DNS yourself.
    :::

6. Click your avatar in the upper right corner, select Admin panel:

    <Zoom src='/datalore/img/deploy/docker/docker-2.png' alt='Datalore admin panel' />


7. In the admin panel menu on the left, choose *License* and provide your license key:

    <Zoom src='/datalore/img/deploy/docker/docker-3.png' alt='Datalore license details' />

## Optional steps

### Use an external Postgres database <MajorUpdates/>

If you want to use an external Postgres database, follow these steps:

1. Add the following variables under the `environment` in your `docker-compose.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    datalore:
        environment:
            ...
            DB_USER: "<database_user>"
            DB_URL: "jdbc:postgresql://[database_host]:[database_port]/[database_name]"
    ```
    :::caution
    Make sure the `datalore.environment.DB_PASSWORD` value is your user's password to the  database you're using.
    :::

2. In the same file, remove the following block:

    ```yaml
    postgresql:
        image: jetbrains/datalore-postgres:2024.4
        expose: [ "5432" ]
        networks:
        - datalore-backend-network
        volumes:
        - "postgresql-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data"
        environment:
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "changeme"
    ```

3. Remove `volumes.postgresql-data: { }` line from your `docker-compose.yaml` file.


### Activate an email whitelist

You can also activate a whitelist for new user registration. Only users with emails entered to the whitelist can be registered to your Datalore instance.

1. Open your `docker-compose.yaml` file.

2. Add the following parameter and then run `docker compose up -d` command:

    ```yaml
    datalore:
        environment:
            EMAIL_ALLOWLIST_ENABLED: "true"
    ```

3. The Email allowlist tab will now be available in your Admin panel:

    <Zoom src='/datalore/img/deploy/docker/docker-4.png' alt='Datalore email allowlist' />


### Activate user filtration based on Hub group membership

By default, all Hub users can register unless you deactivate registration on the Admin panel. If you want to grant Datalore access only to a specific Hub group members, follow the steps below:

1. Open your `docker-compose.yaml` file.

2. Add the following parameter:

    ```yaml
    datalore:
        environment:
            HUB_ALLOWLIST_GROUP: 'group_name' # Change 'group_name' to the name of the group you want to allow access to Datalore
    ```

### Configure notebook code import

Set your own value in bytes to configure the limit of notebook code import.

1. Open the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

2. Add the following parameter:

    ```yaml
    datalore:
        environment:
            VFS_MAX_IMPORT_SOURCE_LENGTH: 'integer, prefixes (K-, M-, etc.) not supported'
    ```
