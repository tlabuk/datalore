# General information

Welcome to my solution of the Datalore documentation tasks!

In this document you can find my feedback on the current state of the documents I reworked. You'll also find a list of proposed changes, so you can easily pinpoint them in each solution document.

## What to expect?

The tasks are split by folders you can see in the main sidebar, each containing a solution document. Here's a quick overview of the tasks:
    - [Task 1–On-premise installation](/datalore/task-1)
    - [Task 2–Update documentation for the Viewer user-type](/datalore/task-2)
    - [Task 3–DuckDB](/datalore/task-3)

:::info
You'll notice that I refactored the existing Datalore's documentation for **on-premises installation** and **managing users**.

Some updates are *subtle and minor* (such as formatting, elisions, wording, improved heading structure). Others are *more substantial*: wherever that's the case, I added <MajorUpdate/> badges to the relevant sections for easy reference.

You can also check the relevant changelog sections in this document for the recap of changes for each rewritten documentation set.

## Overview and rationale for changes

### Task 1–On-premises installation

In this task I revised the [on-premises documentation](/datalore/task-1/). I **replaced complex phrases** with simpler language and switched from using “we” to “Datalore” to keep the tone direct and clear For example: "We duly notify our customers of new version releases so they can promptly upgrade" [...] sounds better in this form:

:::note
We’ll notify you as soon as we release ne version of Datalore, so you can upgrade your on-premise deployment without delay.

As a rule, Docker deployments update faster and more easily than Kubernetes ones.
:::

I also included subheadings up to the `h4` level in the auto-generated table of contents, which helps find information faster.

In the [installation overview](/datalore/task-1/), I also **replaced technical jargon** like `greenfield` to more accessible language; I also used elided forms consistently (as a best practice in technical documentation). I fixed a [**deployment comparison table**](/datalore/task-1/#set-up-infrastructure--choose-an-installation-method-) that has an [empty third column](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/datalore/datalore-on-premises.html#installation-process-overview). I reworked it, **clarified the descriptions**, **reformatted the hardware requirements**, and added extra admonition notes. I also **moved the configuration steps to a reusable file** and organized them into tabs. It felt like there were too many long tables in the document.

For the [Docker installation](/datalore/task-1/docker) guide, I corrected **broken links** (such as `https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/guides/deploy-webapp-ec2/`) and **made sure that external links open in a new tab**. I replaced the heavily styled “Frames tiles” with a **simpler layout** using headings, paragraphs, and lists. When there are too many frames rendered in one view, it's quite hard to focus on the text.

The **original instructions assumed a high level of familiarity with Docker**, so I added basic steps—such as the exact command for composing the `YAML` file. From my experience, **it's best to put basic information in such documents**, and assume that **your readers might be "blank slates"**. You can find one such recent example in the [section](https://docs.nobl9.com/api/slo-v2#tag/SLO/paths/~1slos/get) I've recently added to the Nobl9 API documentation about using pagination prompted by a question asked by a user (junior engineer).

I also **fixed the references to objects** in the `docker-compose.yaml` file, **inserted screenshots** for steps like the allowlist configuration.

Additionally, I **updated the user access information** to note that the first user to log in receives super‑admin rights (the [instruction here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/datalore/install-datalore-on-premises-using-docker.html#-ov5yay_37) mentions only admin permissions), and I renamed the “basic installation” section to “install datalore” to avoid confusion.

### Task 1–changelog

- Added a table of contents with subheadings up to h4

**Installation Overview**
- Replaced jargon with simpler terms
- Fixed a broken table by recoding it, simplifying descriptions, and reformatting hardware requirements

**Docker Installation**
- Fixed broken links and ensured all have the `target="_blank"` attribute

:::info disclaimer
While I didn't work on Kubernetes instructions, as I wanted to focus on other tasks, similar changes could be applied to that section as well.

Other parts of the documentation could also benefit from similar changes, while documents such as the one on deploying Datalore on EC2 instance might require detailed refactoring that will include more detailed instructions for AWS configuration.

## Task 2–Manage users

As part of this task, I  reviewed and improved the [Manage Users](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/datalore/manage-users.html#i7dhuxw_1) documentation based on an implementation ticket you provided. I tested the functionality in my local deployment of Datalore and, based on this experience, I made several improvements and additions to [existing documentation](/datalore/task-2/).

The original **introduction felt incomplete**, so I added a concise summary of the document. To improve clarity, I also **added a screenshot of the admin panel** that provides some **visual overview**.

The **roles table** was missing details on **Viewer capabilities**, which was relevant in the context of the ticket. I **updated it** and included an introductory sentence for better readability. Additionally, I **clarified that Viewers don't have role types** (I'd suggest adding a tooltip in the new user form which will show on hovering inactive dropdown with user roles while viewer type is selected). Additionally, I identified and **filled gaps in visual documentation** by adding missing screenshots wherever necessary.

To improve clarity, I **reformatted step-by-step procedures into ordered lists** all over the document (following tech writing standards). I also **refined procedural phrasing**, replacing **"to finish the procedure"** with simply "Click the create button". Additionally, I added an **admonition** was added to highlight that **converting a Viewer to a User is irreversible**, requiring **deletion and re-creation** of the account if a downgrade is needed:

In testing the implementation, I observed some UX inconsistencies or gaps not covered in the ticket you shared. While **changing a Viewer to a User was possible, downgrading back was not**. In the **Share Notebook** tab, the **"Can edit"** and **"Can manage"** options should ideally be **greyed out** when the notebook is shared with a Viewer. Additionally, I noticed that **groups can contain both Users and Viewers**, which contradicted the ticket’s description. To address these findings, I **added a dedicated section** on [sharing behavior with Viewers](/datalore/task-2/#managing-and-sharing-resources-with-viewers), to make sure the documentation **reflects actual user experience** rather than just the ticket’s assumptions.

## Task 3–DuckDB

Check the [task solution overview](/datalore/task-3/) for details about my approach to the task and my solution.


## Some UX feedback

As I deployed Datalore and tested the features, I noticed some UX microcopy areas in the UI that could be improved and I thought I'd share them with you.
