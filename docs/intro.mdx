# General information

Welcome to my solution of the Datalore documentation tasks!

In this document you can find my feedback on the current state of the documents I've reworked. You'll also find a list of proposed changes, so you can easily pinpoint them in each solution document.

## What to expect?

The tasks are split by folders you can see in the main sidebar, each containing a solution document. Here's a quick overview of the tasks:
    - [Task 1–On-premise installation](/datalore/task-1)
    - [Task 2–Update documentation for the Viewer user-type](/datalore/task-2)
    - [Task 3–DuckDB](/datalore/task-3)

:::info
You'll notice that I've refactored the existing Datalore's documentation for **on-premises installation** and **managing users**.

Some updates are *subtle and minor* (such as formatting, elisions, wording, improved heading structure). Others are *more substantial*: wherever that's the case, I've added <MajorUpdate/> badges to the relevant sections for easy reference.

You can also check the relevant changelog sections in this document for the recap of changes for each rewritten documentation set.

## Overview and rationale for changes

### Task 1–On-premises installation

In this task I revised the [on-premises documentation](/datalore/task-1/) to make it clearer and easier to follow. I replaced complex phrases with simpler language and switched from using “we” to “Datalore” to keep the tone direct and clear For example: We duly notify our customers of new version releases so they can promptly upgrade [...] sounds better in this form:

:::note
We’ll notify you as soon as we release ne version of Datalore, so you can upgrade your on-premise deployment without delay.

As a rule, Docker deployments update faster and more easily than Kubernetes ones.

I also added a table of contents that now shows subheadings up to the h4 level, which helps readers find information faster.

In the installation overview, I've also replaced technical terms like `greenfield` to more accessible language, along with consistent use of elided forms (a a best practice in technical documentation). I've fixed a [deployment comparison table](/datalore/task-1/#set-up-infrastructure--choose-an-installation-method-) that has an empty third column. I've recoded it, clarified the descriptions, reformatted the hardware requirements, and added extra admonition notes. I've also moved The configuration steps to a reusable file and organized them into tabs. It felt like there were too many long tables in the document.

For the Docker installation guide, I corrected broken links and made sure that external links open in a new tab. I replaced the heavily styled “Frames tiles” with a simpler layout using headings, paragraphs, and lists. When there are too many frames rendered in one view, it's quite hard Since the original instructions assumed a high level of familiarity with Docker or Kubernetes, I added basic steps—such as the exact command for composing the YAML file—and cleared up some of the jargon. I also fixed the references in the docker-compose.yaml file, inserted screenshots for steps like the allowlist configuration, and included instructions for testing the deployment locally. Additionally, I updated the user access information to note that the first user to log in receives super‑admin rights, and I renamed the “basic installation” section to “install datalore” to avoid confusion.
