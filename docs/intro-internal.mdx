{/*
the introduction seemed incomplete

added screenshot after h1 with admin panel overview

the roles table is incomplete, in the sense that it misses the description of viewer capabilities - i update it

added introductory sentence to the roles table - best practice in tech writing

Add note under that viewers have NO ROLE TYPES, I'd add tooltip on UI, also added a screenshot for reference clarification

Instructions how to accomplish something should be in ordered lists - again, best practice in tech writing

Another thing: Search output is limited to 100 records. - is there any pagination?

You don't use "to finish the procedure" for easy steps, rather "to finish/complete
added this screenshot and the caution admonition


:::caution
Changing type from viewer to user is irreversible.

If you want to downgrade a specific user to viewer, you'll need to delete their account and add them again with a **Viewer** type.
:::"

Change user type: possible viewer - to user, but you can't downgrade it
In the share notebook tab, it'd be good to grey out the options can edit and can manage if the notebook is shared with viewer

Groups can have users and viewers, so the ticket isn't correct

I added a separate short section on the UX related to sharing things with viewers

REMEMBER ABOUT MICROCOPY FEEDBACK, CHECK SCREENSHOTS
