# Manage users

As an administrator, you can manage users through the Admin panel. To access it, click your avatar icon in the top-right corner of the interface and select Admin panel from the dropdown menu. From there, you can view, add, edit, and remove users, as well as manage their roles and permissions.

This document provides an overview of the user management capabilities available in Datalore.

## User types and roles <MajorUpdate/>

Datalore supports different user types and roles, each with distinct permissions and access levels. The table below outlines these types, their capabilities, and the roles available to users.

| **Type** | **Description** | **Capabilities / Roles** |
|---|---|---|
| **Viewer** | A **view-only** user type who can only access notebooks and reports shared with them. Viewers can't create new notebooks or publish reports. | **Capabilities:**<br/>- Can view shared notebooks and reports.<br/>- Cannot create, clone, or share notebooks or reports.<br/>- Sharing edit rights is disabled.<br/>- Cannot join groups with regular users.<br/>- file system view is the same as that of regular users. |
| **User** | A user who can fully use the functionality of Datalore. Specific privileges vary based on the assigned role (check the Capabilities/Roles column on the right) | **There are three user roles available**:<br/>- **Regular:** A regular user who can create notebooks, workspaces and reports but has no admin rights<br/>- **Admin**: An admin user with access to the Admin panel<br/>- **Super Admin:** an admin user who can also change other users' roles via the Admin panel. First user registered with Datalore is automatically a super admin. |

:::note
Viewers don'tt have role types, as their access is strictly limited to viewing shared notebooks and reports without the ability to create, edit, or manage content.

When you create a user with **viewer** type, you'll see that the dropdwon with roles is greyed out:

:::

## Plans <MajorUpdate/>

Datalore offers different types of plans to manage user access and resource allocation. Depending on your organization's setup, users may have a default personal plan, a non-default personal plan, or a group plan. The tabs below explain how each plan type works and how they interact.

<Tabs queryString="plans" className="custom-tabs">
  <TabItem value="default-personal-plan" label="Default Personal Plan">

  A **default personal plan** is assigned to all users according to your Datalore configuration and marked as default when viewing the users.
  It can later be changed for a non-default personal plan or group plan assigned from the **Admin panel** by a **super admin**.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="non-default-personal-plan" label="Non-Default Personal Plan">

  A **non-default personal plan** is assigned to an individual user from Datalore's UI (**Admin panel > Manage users**).
  When assigned, it takes priority over any group plans that are already or will be associated with this user, until a different personal plan is assigned.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="group-plans" label="Group Plans">

  **Group plans** are assigned by super admins to all members when creating or editing a group from Datalore's UI (**Admin panel > Groups**).
  This makes sense when the members of a group don'tt have personal plans assigned to them individually
  and you want to select one plan that will work for all of them.

  When a user is a member of several groups, the plan that is listed last in the plan configuration has priority over the other group plans associated with this user.
  However, assigning a **personal plan** to a member of a group overrides any current or future group plan assignments for this user.

  Managing group plans is described in **[Manage user groups](#manage-user-groups)**.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
